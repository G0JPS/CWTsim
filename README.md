CWTsim
G0JPS [2080], Oct 2019

WHAT IS CWTsim?
The script does two things. It fetches a CWOPs member list from
the web and stores it in an array.

Secondly it outputs the text of a running CWT station, either
to send to students during a zoom session for CWT practice, or
to paste into CW Player to generate an audio file for them.

*If* I can get sound working, I hope to make it simulate a running station!
