# CWTsim
G0JPS [2080], Jun 2019

WHAT IS CWTsim?
The script does two things. It fetches a CWOPs member list from
the web and stores it in memory.

Then it displays a selction of random entries for an advisor
to send to students during a zoom session for CWT practice.


SUPPORT
 1. RTFM
 2. Ah. There is no manual.
 3. Read XKCD instead. It won't help with this program, but it's funny.
